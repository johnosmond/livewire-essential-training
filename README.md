# Livewire Essential Training

This is my repository for following a LinkedIn Learning tutorial called *Livewire Essential Training*.

## Codespaces

The author has provide all the exercise files as a codespace on GitHub, but I like to follow along with my own project. I learn more deeply that way.

## Course Not Worth It

For those of you thinking about taking the course, it was horrible. First, I could not get the Codespace server to work. Second, I created a local repository to follow along, but several times the instructor edited the video and cut out parts that I needed to see in order to be able to follow along. Third, several times I checked his code from the GitHub repository to figure out what I had missed only to find code there that he hadn't gone over. Fourth, there were some features that did not work as expected. 

I do not recommend this course.
